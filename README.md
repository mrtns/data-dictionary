# Jobs to be done

Overall

* I WANT a single place to reference all my data  
  SO THAT I donâ€™t have to jump to different tools to see definitions, metrics, stories, reports, etc

  * I WANT to maintain a git and markdown based data dictionary  
    SO THAT all changes are source controlled


In Detail

* I WANT to add markdown files representing components  
  SO THAT each component is a plain text file
